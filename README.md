This website is based on the TV show "Avatar: The Last Airbender" and focuses on the four elements: water, earth,
fire, and air. The website consists of a home page, where the user may select an element page to visit, and four
element pages, each with some kind of fun table or list available, including a gif from the show and buttons to 
visit any of the other pages available.

home.html
This is the file for the home page. Not much is shown on this page, other than a header instructing the user to
select an element, and 4 'buttons' that link to the element pages. These are not actually bootstrap buttons, but
divs with colourful backgrounds and borders, and a transparent image of the respective element. These divs, however,
are within a flex wrapped container, allowing them to shift when the screen size is changed by the user.

water.html
The water page consists of a title, small paragraph, table, gif, and page buttons. The table is an informative
comparison of the three Water Tribes from the Avatar show and has matching border colours with the page's title.

earth.html
The earth page consists of a title, small paragraph, table, gif and page buttons. The unordered list provided is 
a list of some earthbending abilities from the Avatar show and has bolded headers.

fire.html
The fire page consists of a title, small paragraph, table, gif and page buttons (are you seeing a trend here?).
The unordered list shown contains quotes from the Avatar show by the character referred to in the paragraph above it.

air.html
The air page consists of a title, small paragraph, gif and page buttons. The table is made to look like two tables in one, allowing comparison between two pairs of examples in two different catagories.

style.scss / style.css
Stylesheets for the home page and four element pages.
